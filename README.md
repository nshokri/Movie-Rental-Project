# Movie-Rental-Project
A program that a movie rental store such as Blockbusters would use to keep track of their inventory, customers, and customer rentals.

This was the final project for my data structures and algorithms class. Class structure designed in a group of 5 people (view UML diagram: https://app.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/8bdd59c3-12ee-4b7e-b32b-aa26bd829ded) and implemented in C++ with one other person.


Note: If you are currently taking the same class and the professor uses the same project, please do not look or copy any part of this project.
